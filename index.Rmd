title: "R Best Practice"
---


This document sets out the proposals for best practice when using R. The aim is to provide 
a consistent and comprehensive approach to using R for analysis and applications. It forms 
part of the wider guidance on end-user computing. The document is split into the following 
areas:

 1. **Software**: Details the recommended software to install, both the core R 
    applications and supporting software.
 2. **Writing**: Gives guidance on on how to write R scripts and applications.
 3. **Packages**: Lists the recommended packages to use for achieving common tasks.
 4. **Development**: Describes the recommended approaches to developing in R.

This document is not supposed to be a comprehensive guide to using R. It gives guidance
and sign-posts users to resources with more details.


## End-User Computing

The Bank of England's 2016 report 
[_Solvency II: internal model approval process data review findings_](pra_solvency2)
identifies end-user computing as a Solvency II risk. In particular, it states:

> Spreadsheets and other user-developed applications are a form of information technology, 
> and all information technology needs to be appropriately controlled.

End-user computing requires a user to think about the following areas when developing
in R:

 - Risk analysis
 - Documentation
 - Testing
 - Reproducibility
 - Change control
 - Access control

The result of the risk analysis determines the level at which the subsequent points
need to be addressed.


## Risk Analysis

The level of documentation, testing and change control depends on two factors:

1. Complexity
2. Criticality

**Complexity:** If a piece of work is very simple it may only require a short 
description, a manual test and saving to a secure location. However, if it is highly 
complex it is important for others, and your future self, to document it thoroughly, 
provide repeatable tests and save the scripts in version control.

**Criticality:** If a piece of work is a simple analysis for curiosity it may not 
need any controls applied to it. However, if it provides functionality which other 
systems rely on or informs major business decisions then it is important to ensure 
it is thoroughly tested and reviewed and changes are not made without careful 
consideration of how it affects dependents.

In order to assess the level of controls perform a simple risk analysis by estimating 
the level of complexity and criticality of the work, using a scale of **high**, 
**medium** or **low**. If both are low then no further consideration is required. However, 
If any of the above factors are medium or high then the work is considered material 
and should be subject to the following controls.


## Documentation

As a minimum the following should be documented with the code. For simple scripts, a 
commented header in the file is sufficient. For multi-file applications it is recommended 
that a [README](writing-structure.html#readme) file is added.

 - Name
 - Description
 - Purpose
 - Instructions

For **high complexity** work the following should be considered

 - Write documentation for each section/function of code separately 
 - Provide examples
 
For **high criticality** work consider creating an 
[R package](packages-development.html) then:

 - Create a [DESCRIPTION](packages-development.html#description) file to document 
   the package.
 - Use the package [`Roxygen2`](packages-development.html#documentation) to document 
   functions.
 - Write a [vignette](packages-development.html#vignette) explaining its use.


## Testing

As a minimum, manual tests should be performed and the results recorded alongside the 
code. This may take the following forms:

 - Assertions in the code to ensure reasonableness, e.g. result is within a range.
 - Comparisons with known results.

For **high complexity** work consider the following:

 - Separate tests for each section/function of code.
 - Comparisons with simple inputs and expected results

For **high criticality** work consider creating an 
[R package](packages-development.html) then:

 - Use the package [`testthat`](packages-development.html#testing) to write 
   executable tests.
 - Execute regression tests whenever changes are made.
 - Perform integration tests with dependent systems.


## Reproducibility

Important work should reproducible by others, and your future self. This means keeping 
track of inputs, parameters and code used to produce results. The simplest approach 
is to keep a copy of input data and parameters alongside the the code used to produce
the saved results. Then it is self-contained.

Also consider using [R markdown](writing-rmarkdown.html) which captures 
description, code and results in a single document.

For **high complexity** work consider creating an 
[RStudio project](writing-structure.html#projects) it has the following benefits:

 - Sets the current working directory so relative file paths can be used.
 - Saves open files so you can start where you left off.

Some other recommendations worth considering are:

 - Avoid referencing external files if possible.
 - Make dependencies clear.
 - Cache versions of input data into a subfolder, if not large.

For **high criticality** work also consider

 - Outputting audit logs with time stamp, username and computing environment
 - Holding inputs in version control

 
## Change control

Change control is about managing updates and bug fixes to the code in a way that is 
tracked, reviewed, and approved. It ensures change, and its implications, is understood 
and can also be reversed, if necessary. The simplest approach is to produce new files 
for each version, keeping older versions elsewhere. Each new version should document 
the reason for the change.

A much better solution is to use version control software to track changes. This makes 
the process much more robust. It is recommended that [Git](development.html#git) is used 
for version control and shared using a hosting application such as GitHub (or TFS if not
available).

For **high complexity** and/or **criticality** consider the following:

 - Track changes in the hosting application (GitHub or TFS).
 - Record description and reason for change and prioritise.
 - Create a new branch for each change.
 - Merge back into the main branch only after a review.
 - Require approval from an appropriate person or group before releasing to production.


## Access control

There should be appropriate controls on who has access to the source code and/or results. 
The developers should be aware of who has access the work they are producing. The simplest 
approach is to save files into a location with adequate access controlled by the IT dept.
It may also be appropriate to limit who has the ability to change the source code 
separately.

For **high complexity** work it is important only those with the appropriate level of 
knowledge can change the code.

For **high criticality** work production code should not be changable directly. A release 
process should be set up so appropriate approval must be given before code is promoted.

In both cases:

 - The list of people with access to the source code and results should be reviewed on a
   regular basis.
 - Appropriate back up and recovery strategies should be implemented to ensure rollback 
   and re-installation is possible.

#### Sub-risk 5: IT environment, technology and tools

> Spreadsheets and other user-developed applications are a form of information technology, 
> and all information technology needs to be appropriately controlled.

###### Finding 9: end-user computing (EUC)

4.36 Spreadsheets and other end-user applications (2012.4.39) remained common in capital 
and balance sheet modelling. The PRA does not have a view on whether end-user computing 
(EUC) is appropriate, as it is a form of IT, and all IT needs to be appropriately 
controlled. Where EUC is material to the internal model data flow, the PRA will be looking 
for appropriate controls for data quality such as reasonableness checks, input validations,
peer reviews, systems environment configuration, logical access management, ongoing change
controls (development, build , systems and user acceptance testing) and release management
(including implementation and operational testing), disaster recovery, and documentation.

4.37 Automation of spreadsheets reduces the risk of manual error (2012.4.42), but can
introduce different problems such as reduced oversight, inadequate transparency about the
extent of linking and the proliferation of nested spreadsheets and the attendant issue of
‘broken links’.

4.38 The 2012 report did not engage comprehensively with cyber risk. This is likely to be 
an area of increasing focus, following alerts and increasing concerns about security as 
firms move away from localised application and onto networked platforms. As noted in the 
Bank of England Financial Stability Report,1 cyber attacks can threaten financial stability 
by disrupting the provision of critical functions from the financial system to the real
economy. The Financial Policy Committee has recommended that resilience testing be a 
regular part of core firms’ cyber resilience assessment. Insurers providing cover for cyber 
or business interruption are also indirectly exposed to cyber risk.

###### Finding 10: IT infrastructure

4.39 Complex IT implementations (2012.4.44) can be challenging to manage without a clear
definition of user requirements, design, testing and appropriate controls for effective
operation in business as usual. This continued to be an area of risk. One firm took seven
years to implement a tactical system, and still has no strategic system for its upstream
administration processes.
