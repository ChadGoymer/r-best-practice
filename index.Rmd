This document sets out the best practice guidelines for using R.

# Tidyverse

It is recommended, when using R, that we use the "[Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)"
approach and packages wherever possible. The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed 
for data science, as well as a philosophy and style for formating data and writing functions.
The [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/) website details the packages involved and
contains articles on how to use them. Some of it will be summarised below, but the website
contains the definitive information.

The most in-depth treatment on the Tidyverse can be found in the book "R for Data Science", 
which is available online for free at [r4ds.had.co.nz](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
