# Writing R Code {#writing}

## Writing Style

When writing code it is important to follow a common style so it is readable and 
other people, and your future self, can easily understand and extend it. 


### Tidyverse

It is recommended, when using R, that we use the "[Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)"
approach and packages wherever possible. The Tidyverse is a collection of packages designed 
for data science, as well as a philosophy and style for formatting data and writing functions.
The [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/) website details the packages involved and
contains articles on how to use them. Some of it will be summarised below, but the website
contains the definitive information.

The most in-depth treatment on the Tidyverse can be found in the book "R for Data Science", 
which is available online for free at [r4ds.had.co.nz](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

The tidyverse has an extensive [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/), which we 
summarise here:


### Files

 - File names should be meaningful and end in `.R`, or `.Rmd` for R markdown files. Only
   use letters, numbers and `-` or `_`.
 - If your script required packages load them all at once at the very beginning of the 
   file.
 - Use comments to explain the "why" not the "what" or "how".
 - Break up files into named sections using commented lines (`# ----`, example below). In 
   RStudio you can collapse and expand sections commented this way.

```
# Load data --------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Syntax

 - Variable and function names should use only lowercase letters, numbers, and `_`.
 - Always indent the code inside curly braces `{}` by two spaces.


### Functions

 - Use verbs for function names where possible.
 - If a function has numerous arguments put each one on a new line.
 - A function should do one thing well. If it is doing too much the break it up.
 - A function should be easily understandable in isolation. It should not refer
   to any variables outside the function scope.


### Pipes

 - Use `%>%` when you find yourself composing three or more functions together, 
   instead of a nested call.
 - `%>%` should always have a space before it and a new line after it. After the 
   first step, each line should be indented by two spaces.


### Documentation

 - Created functions should be documentated so others, including the future you, 
   can understand what the function does and how to use it.
 - Documentation should be written before the function definition in an 
   [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html)
   style. roxygen uses special comments, starting with `#'`. The first line is the 
   title, and anything else, not prefixed with a keyword forms the description.
   Keywords start with `@` and the most important ones are `@param` to describe 
   a function parameter and `@return` to describe what the function returns.

Here is a very simple example:

```r
#' The length of a string.
#'
#' This function returns the number of characters in the supplied string.
#' 
#' @param string input character vector
#'
#' @return integer vector giving number of characters in each element of the
#'   character vector.
#'
#' @export
#'
str_length <- function(string) {
  nchar(string)
}
```


## Structure

Organising files for a particular piece of work becomes more important as the scale and 
complexity increases. Standard approaches exists to simplify the workflow.


### Projects

Use RStudio projects to organise files. This has a number of advantages:

1. Sets the working directory to the project location
1. Reopens the same files when returning to the projects


### Folders

When an analysis becomes complex it should be split up into logical parts and stored in 
subfolders. Store the original data in a folder, unchanged. It is better to "cleanse" input
data with an R script as it can repeated when data changes, and/or the approach changed 
itself.

R code may also be stored in a separate folder. You may have an R script for cleansing the 
data and another for performing an analysis. Include an R script at the top level which 
executes the code in the subfolder in the appropriate order. Use relative paths to the 
files. If an RStudio project has been created the working directory will be set to the 
project directory automatically.

Output the results, plots, data, etc, in another folder so it is clear whether data files 
are results rather than inputs.

An example of a project structure:

 - data
    - interesting_data.xlsx
    - reference_data.csv
 - R
    - clean_data.R
    - analyse.R
 - tests
    - test_cleansed_data.R
    - test_analysis.R
 - results
    - cool_plot.png
    - table_of_results.csv
 - run_code.R 
 - README.md


### README

Adding a README file is a good way to explain to other, and you future self, what the analysis
does and how to use it. The [documentation](index.html#documentation) section of the best 
practice has more detail on what should be included.

It is recommended that [markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-8.html) is used to 
write the README. It is a very simple way to specify text formatting in a plain text file
and can be converted to many other formats (HTML, docx, PDF) if required. In addition, if 
the package is stored in GitHub a markdown README is automatically rendered on the 
repository's page.


### R Packages

When R code has high criticality consider turning it into a package. A package is a way 
of collecting together related code in a robust way. It has the following advantages:

 - Easier to share with others (as a zip file)
 - Documentation is compiled into help pages
 - All tests can be executed with a single command
 - Can implement a development and release process
 - Code is broken up into useful functions

Writing a package is very straight forward with the helper packages available today. More
information can be found in [Package Development](packages-development.html).


## R Markdown

[R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a way of capturing documentation, code and
results and in a single file. The document is written in plain text using a style called 
[markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html). This has a simple syntax 
for specifying text formatting. R code is added in "chunks" and when the document is 
rendered the R code is executed and replaced with the results.

R markdown can be used to produce web pages, Word  and PDF documents. The provide a
robust way of capturing an analysis and the results and can be re-run when the data
changes.

RStudio provides a cheatsheet detailing R markdown functionality:

```{r rmarkdown-cheatsheet, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='R Markdown Cheat Sheet', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.png")
# https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf
```


### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is 
designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats.
