[R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a way of capturing documentation, code and
results and in a single file. The document is written in plain text using a style called 
[markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html). This has a simple syntax 
for specifying text formatting. R code is added in "chunks" and when the document is 
rendered the R code is executed and replaced with the results.

R markdown can be used to produce web pages, Word  and PDF documents. The provide a
robust way of capturing an analysis and the results and can be re-run when the data
changes.

RStudio provides a cheatsheet detailing R markdown functionality:
