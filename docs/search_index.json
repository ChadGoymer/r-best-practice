A package combines a set of related functionality which can then be shared easily between projects and other users. The package devtools makes package development straight forward. For more detailed information about creating packages, read the R Packages book or use the cheatsheet below for reference. NOTE: devtools is currently being split up into smaller packages and the above book and cheatsheet are slightly out of date. Package development has a formal structure, which addresses many of the areas detailed in the End-User Computing standards. The package usethis provides functions to ease the setup of the package structure. To set up an empty package use: usethis::create_package(&quot;pkgname&quot;) Functions you wish to add to the package are saved in scripts in the R subfolder that has been created. 5.1.1 Documentation Documentation comes in three flavours in an R package. The DESCRIPTION file details the package itself including author and dependencies; help files contains documentation for each function in the package; and vignettes are small articles describing how to use the functions in practice. 5.1.1.1 DESCRIPTION The function usethis::create_package() creates the basic structure of the package and a placeholder DESCRIPTION file. You can then edit it manually or use other functions in the usethis package to update it. For more detail, read the Package metadata chapter in the R Packages book. 5.1.1.2 Help Files When writing a function in a package it is good practice to document it, so a user can see how it works with help(\"function_name\"). Documenting a package is as straight forward as including a special commented section before the function definition. The package roxygen2 is then used to convert those comments into help files. For more detail, read the Object documentation chapter in the R Packages book. 5.1.1.3 Vignettes When writing a package, it is also good practice to write a short article explaining how to use it. If the package is complex it may require a number articles describing different aspects. These short articles are called vignettes. Vignettes are written in markdown format and stored in a vignettes subfolder. For more detail, read the Vignettes chapter in the R Packages book. 5.1.2 Testing R packages provide a structure for specifying tests that allows you easily re-run all tests and determine whether something has broken. The package testthat provides functions for specifying tests and comparing the results with expectations. For more detail, read the Testing chapter in the R Packages book. 5.2 Version Control 5.2.1 Git 5.2.2 Git Flow Workflow summary At a high level the development workflow follows the following steps: Create a new branch Merge unapproved PBIs (if required) Commit new functionality Review with a pull request 1. Create a new branch Update the develop branch Create a new branch: &lt;issue-id&gt;-&lt;feature-summary&gt; In GitKraken: Double-click the develop branch to check it out: Click Pull: Right-click the develop branch and click Create branch here: Enter a branch name in the format &lt;issue-id&gt;-&lt;feature-summary&gt;, e.g. 24-syndicate-widget. 2. Merge unapproved PBIs Note: This step is only required if your PBI depends on another PBI which has not yet been approved. Since the dependency will not yet exist in the develop branch you will need to bring the changes in separately. This does introduce a risk that the dependency could change while you are developing, but this should be mitigated by merging the develop branch in again once the dependent PBI has been approved. Checkout the new branch Merge dependent branches In GitKraken: Double-click the branch name to check out Right-click the dependent branch name and select Merge ... into ... Repeat step 2 for all PBIs the current work depends on. 3. Commit new functionality As the new feature is developed make commits as appropriate. You should make at least separate commits for documentation, tests and code. For more information about developing new functionality read the wiki pages on Node Documentation, Node Testing, Tyche Coding Standards and Naming Conventions. Stage changes Make a commit Push to GitHub In GitKraken: Click on the WIP bar at the top of the central window: Click Stage all changes or stage individual files in the right-hand window: Write a commit message and click Commit changes: Click Push in the top bar: If it is the first time pushing to GitHub from the branch you will have to set the remote branch: 4. Review with a Pull Request For more information on peer reviewing visit the wiki page Review Process. Create a pull request and request someone’s review Comment on the code in the pull request Make new commits/request changes as appropriate Merge into develop when complete In GitKraken: In the left-hand window, click on the + in PULL REQUESTS: Set the repository and branch to pull from and the repository and branch to merge into: Specify the PBI the feature addresses by writing resolves # in the description (this will also automatically close the issue once merged). You can also request someone’s review by adding @ e.g. @WalkerC. In GitHub: The reviewer comments on the changes and/or requests a change: The developer or reviewer can make new commits as appropriate: If the develop branch has moved on and you want to test how the current work interacts with a newly published work you can merge the develop branch into the new branch. Right-click the develop branch and select Merge develop into ...: Once review is complete, click Merge pull request and confirm: Click Delete branch: Close the issue If you have not used resolves # in the pull request description, you will need to close the issue manually. Go to the issues page of the repository, enter a comment referencing the pull request and click Close and comment: 5.2.3 GitHub Flow GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. It is similar to Git flow but without a develop branch. Create a branch Add commits Open a pull request Discuss and review code Deploy/Test Merge 1. Create a branch When you’re working on a project, you’re going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time – some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow. When you create a branch in your project, you’re creating an environment where you can try out new ideas. Changes you make on a branch don’t affect the master branch, so you’re free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your branch won’t be merged until it’s ready to be reviewed by someone you’re collaborating with. 2. Add commits Once your branch has been created, it’s time to start making changes. Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you’re making a commit, and adding them to your branch. This process of adding commits keeps track of your progress as you work on a feature branch. Commits also create a transparent history of your work that others can follow to understand what you’ve done and why. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Furthermore, each commit is considered a separate unit of change. This lets you roll back changes if a bug is found, or if you decide to head in a different direction. 3. Open a Pull Request Pull Requests initiate discussion about your commits. Because they’re tightly integrated with the underlying Git repository, anyone can see exactly what changes would be merged if they accept your request. You can open a Pull Request at any point during the development process: when you have little or no code but want to share some screenshots or general ideas, when you’re stuck and need help or advice, or when you’re ready for someone to review your work. By using GitHub’s @mention system in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or ten time zones away. 4. Discuss and review code Once a Pull Request has been opened, the person or team reviewing your changes may have questions or comments. Perhaps the coding style doesn’t match project guidelines, the change is missing unit tests, or maybe everything looks great and props are in order. Pull Requests are designed to encourage and capture this type of conversation. You can also continue to push to your branch in light of discussion and feedback about your commits. If someone comments that you forgot to do something or if there is a bug in the code, you can fix it in your branch and push up the change. GitHub will show your new commits and any additional feedback you may receive in the unified Pull Request view. 5. Deploy/Test With GitHub, you can deploy from a branch for final testing in production before merging to master. Once your pull request has been reviewed and the branch passes your tests, you can deploy your changes to verify them in production. If your branch causes issues, you can roll it back by deploying the existing master into production. 6. Merge Now that your changes have been verified in production, it is time to merge your code into the master branch. Once merged, Pull Requests preserve a record of the historical changes to your code. Because they’re searchable, they let anyone go back in time to understand why and how a decision was made. 5.3 Managing Package Dependencies "]
