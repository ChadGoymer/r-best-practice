title: "Style Guide"
---

When writing code it is important to follow a common style so it is readable and 
other people (and your future self) can easily understand and extend it. The tidyverse 
has an extensive [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/), which we summarise here:

## Files

File names should be meaningful and end in `.R`, or `.Rmd` for R markdown files. Only
use letters, numbers and `-` or `_`.

If your script required packages load them all at once at the very beginning of the 
file.

Break up files into named sections using comments and `----`, for example:

Use comments to explain the "why" not the "what" or "how".

```
# Load data --------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Syntax

Variable and function names should use only lowercase letters, numbers, and `_`.

Always indent the code inside curly braces `{}` by two spaces.

## Functions

Use verbs for function names where possible.

If a function has numerous arguments put each one on a new line.

A function should do one thing well. If it is doing too much the break it up.

A function should be easily understandable in isolation. It should not refer
to any variables outside the function scope.

## Pipes

Use `%>%` when you find yourself composing three or more functions together, 
instead of a nested call.

`%>%` should always have a space before it and a new line after it. After the 
first step, each line should be indented by two spaces.

## Documentation

Created functions should be documentated so others (including the future you) 
can understand what the function does and how to use it.

Documentation should be written before the function definition in an 
[roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html)
style. roxygen uses special comments, starting with `#'`. The first line is the 
title, and anything else, not prefixed with a keyword forms the description.
Keywords start with `@` and the most important ones are `@param` to describe 
a function parameter and `@return` to describe what the function returns.

Here is a very simple example:

```r
#' The length of a string (in characters).
#'
#' This function returns the length of the supplied string.
#' 
#' @param string input character vector
#' @return numeric vector giving number of characters in each element of the
#'   character vector.
str_length <- function(string) {
  nchar(string)
}
```
